# Tab Saver 📝
For a long time now, I had a problem managing my open tabs. 

I always had tabs which I wasn't ready to read or use, so I kept them open for future me to deal with. This eventually got annoying, as I couldn't close the browser or restart my computer without having to re-open them manually.

One day, I had enough, and I created this extention to help me manage my important tabs.
